# Optical-Character-Recognition-Basic.Net
In this project I used the EMGU CV library for optical character recognition the programming language that I used was Visual Basic.Net, I want share with you some tips for integrate this library.

First one you need the import in your project this dll files:

a.- In the references section you need to add:
Emgu.CV
Emgu.CV.OCR
Emgu.CV.UI
Emgu.CV.Util

b.- Bofore that you need copy this files in "solution explorer" section:
cvextern.dll
opencv_calib3d231.dll
opencv_contrib231.dll
opencv_features2d231.dll
opencv_flann231.dll
opencv_gpu231.dll
opencv_highgui231.dll
opencv_imgproc231.dll
opencv_legacy231.dll
opencv_ml231.dll
opencv_objdetect231.dll
opencv_video231.dll

Â¡Important: You need the select "always copied" in the properties of each file!

c.- It is really easy to use this library but you need preprocessing the image before using the character recognition.
